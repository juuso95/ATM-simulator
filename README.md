#ATM 

Individual project - Object-Oriented programming with Java

Otto-teller machine simulator

This project was pretty hard for me and there would be a lot of things i could add to my application.
I think i included all the important things that ATM should include. 
With my application you can deposit, withdraw money and also make a payments.
You can see all the transactions that you've made in Transaction histoy section. 
You can also take a look at Account database which includes details of different accounts.
You can create new accounts or update the old ones and use them to example, make a payments. 
Throught payments, you can transfer money from account to another.

You can find more information from my wiki pages, example username and password for the application!
